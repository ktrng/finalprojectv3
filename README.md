# finalprojectv3
-forked matt's laravel/react app and followed the instructions on the markdown. it does not work locally, however, IT DOES WORK WHEN DEPLOYED!!! (seems like i have an issue with php connecting with postgres, which i have spend the past week trying to debug to no avail)
-recreated my inventory app using matt's laravel/react app as a template. tried to use react components but it does not work. going to deploy now (fingers crossed it works!!)
